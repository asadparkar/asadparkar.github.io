                      this interest slowly turned into my ambition and finally something which i wanted to persue as my career. My Journey in Programming
                      started when i was 16 as a part of my high school course and i started learning Python programming. Over the course, I learned a lot of new
                      and cool things and it was in 2020, when i finally built my first console applicaiton and it was by far the most satisfying thing as it was my first ever 
                      Programming project. And after that, there was no turning back.
